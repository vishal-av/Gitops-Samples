# CD Pipeline definition (for reference only - create in Harness UI)
# This shows how the same manifests work with CD Pipeline

# In Harness UI, you would create:

# 1. Service:
#    - Name: shared-manifests-service
#    - Type: Kubernetes
#    - Manifests:
#        - Source: Git
#        - Repository: <your-git-repo>
#        - Path: GitOps-Secret-Expressions/shared-manifests-example/manifests
#        - Files: *.yaml

# 2. Environment:
#    - Name: dev / prod
#    - Type: Kubernetes
#    - Infrastructure: <your-k8s-cluster>

# 3. Pipeline with Deploy Stage:
#    - Service: shared-manifests-service
#    - Environment: <your-environment>
#    - Execution:
#        - Rolling Deployment
#        - Apply Step uses manifests from Git

# The pipeline will:
# 1. Fetch manifests from Git
# 2. Resolve secret expressions
# 3. Apply to cluster using kubectl

# Same manifests, different deployment method!
